## Example: Processing an article

### Reading the article

Let us have a look at an example of a very short, self-containing article, posted in April 1999 on the [CNN](http://cnn.com/) website. This short article can be read in minutes and can serve as a positive incentive towards adjustments in your diet.

> Antioxidants may slow aging process, study says April 5, 1999 Web posted at: 9:39 p.m. EDT (0139 GMT) From Correspondent Linda Ciampa -- Research at Tufts University indicates that a healthy diet fortified with certain fruits and vegetables may slow down and even reverse the aging process. Foods rich in antioxidants -- such as blueberries, strawberries, spinach and broccoli -- have what doctors call high ORAC (Oxygen Radical Absorption Capacity) levels. Middle-aged rats who were fed a high ORAC diet in the USDA-sponsored study experienced less memory loss than those given a normal diet. Some of the older, slower rats became as lively as their younger peers after taking antioxidants. "We prevented both some brain and some behavioral changes that one normally sees in these rats when they hit 15 months of age," said USDA researcher Jim Joseph. Antioxidants are effective in destroying free radicals -- cell-damaging compounds that can help cause cancer and heart disease and speed the aging process. "It's pretty well accepted that aging is due to the production of free radicals. So anything we can do nutritionally to provide additional antioxidants is likely to protect us in the process of aging," Joseph said. That fact already has prompted many to eat a diet rich in antioxidants. "I look at it as sort of a savings account. I'm benefiting today from eating right, but I'm also going to have it in the future," said 30-year-old Cori Alcock. "As I age and grow older, I'll have good health as well."

### Extracting the essence from the article

In the course of reading, you should select the most important sections of the article. The article introduces some facts related to healthy diet and adds a lot of redundant explanations. For your review, you are only likely to need the core message which usually makes up a fraction of the entire text. Please have a look again at the same text with four most critical sections emphasized (numbering is not needed and is used only for your convenience for further reference):

> Research indicates that a healthy (1) diet fortified with certain fruits and vegetables may slow down and even reverse the aging process. (2) Foods rich in antioxidants -- such as blueberries, strawberries, spinach and broccoli -- have high ORAC (Oxygen Radical Absorption Capacity) levels.

### Improving the wording of extracts

Once you extract important fragments from an article, you may need to reformulate individual fragments to make sure they are fully context independent, free of redundant information, easy to read, and formulated in such a way that the beginning of the fragment serves as the introduction to the latter phrases and not vice versa. Please have a look at the [example from the healthy diet article](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning#Extracting_the_essence_from_the_article). We selected four important fragments and these fragments (presented on the left in the table) were reformulated to become fully-independent pieces of information (on the right). Please note that two fragments have generated more than one reworded fragment and that one fragment was deleted as it appeared to be redundant upon closer analysis.

Although we have generated 20 [cloze deletions](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion) from the original 5 [extracts](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Extract), it is important to stress that reviewing this much of the learning material will ultimately cost you less time and the memory effect will be better! Note that [cloze deletions](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion) meticulously test your knowledge of all important semantic aspects of the learned article.

### Converting cloze deletions to plain questions

After you extract fragments and formulate [active recall](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Active_recall) questions, you should continue to constantly reevaluate the importance of individual pieces of information, their wording, delete less important pieces and move them for later review, etc. Examples of reformulated [cloze deletions](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion) can be found below. Note that [Clozes](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion) 4-6 and [Cloze](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion) 20 have been split further to eliminate set enumeration (it is easier to independently associate cancer or aging with free radicals than to list all health problems caused by them)

## Example: Rewording texts

Wordy articles may require some rewording of sentences before [cloze deletions](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion) can be generated.

For example, the following texts puzzled a user as it appeared to be hard to process incrementally:

> *In 1892 the Russian botanist Dimitri Iwanowski showed that the sap from tobacco plants infected with mosaic disease, even after being passed through a porcelain filter known to retain all bacteria, contained an agent that could infect other tobacco plants.*
>
> *In 1900 a similarly filterable agent was reported for foot-and-mouth disease of cattle.*

Before you begin learning, you can save lots of time by looking for articles that are properly structured and written in a concise language that will help you save lots of time. For example, [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/) is an excellent source. As it is edited by many people in an incremental manner, it is highly context-independent. In comparison, [Britannica](http://britannica.com/) is wordy, full of pronouns, definite clauses, and various context references.

Where [Britannica](http://britannica.com/) might say (fictitious example): "*Over the next five years, he struggled to obtain a patent for his invention*", [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/) might say explicitly "*In the years 1883-1889, Edison struggled to obtain a patent for a filament of carbon of high resistance*". This context-independent style can save you hours of parsing and re-editing.

In the presented example, the first sentence is causing trouble because the author tried to tell you far more than you might wish to process in one go.

One strategy is to start with monster [clozes](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion), and simplify them incrementally while learning. However, you could save lots of time with another strategy, in which you split the sentences into more manageable portions. Unfortunately, in this case, some editing will be necessary in the beginning. You will also need to carefully parse the meaning of the passage. You could, for example, separate *who* and *what* components of the sentence

> **who**: In 1892 the Russian botanist Dimitri Iwanowski showed that the sap from tobacco plants infected with mosaic disease contained an infectious agent smaller than bacteria.
>
> **what**: In 1892, Iwanowski showed that the sap from tobacco infected with mosaic disease even after being passed through a porcelain filter known to retain all bacteria, contained an agent that could infect other tobacco plants.

From those two mini-[topics](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Topic), you can generate several [clozes](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Cloze_deletion) that will cover the essence of the passage:

> **Question**: In **[...](year)** the Russian botanist Dimitri Iwanowski showed that the sap from tobacco plants infected with mosaic disease contained an infectious agent smaller than bacteria

The above questions are only a rough beginning. Only during learning will you be able to identify holes in these [items](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary:Item). You will see where they cause trouble, why they may be hard to remember or what questions are imprecise or confusing. You will fix those deficiencies incrementally while learning.
